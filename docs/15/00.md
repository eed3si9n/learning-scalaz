day 15
------

On [day 14][day14] we started hacking on Scalaz. First, typeclass instances for `Vector` was added to `import Scalaz._`. Next, we rolled back `<*>` to be infix `ap`. Finally, we added an implicit converter to unpack `A` as `[α]A`, which helps compiler find `Applicative[({type λ[α]=Int})#λ]`.

All three of the pull requests were accepted by the upstream! Here's how to sync up:

<div style="clear: both;"
```
$ git co scalaz-seven
$ git pull --rebase
```

Let's take a moment to see some of the typeclasses I was looking.
