[Yesterday][day3] we reviewed kinds and types, explored Tagged type, and started looking at `Semigroup` and `Monoid` as a way of abstracting binary operations over various types.

I've gotten a few feedbacks. First, paulp suggested that I could use companion type like `Option.type` for our `kind` calculator:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>@<a href="https://twitter.com/eed3si9n">eed3si9n</a> It’s a sad hack, but you should be able to ask for kind[Option.type] and look up the kind of the companion class.</p>&mdash; Paul Phillips (@extempore2) <a href="https://twitter.com/extempore2/status/242672251533676544">September 3, 2012</a></blockquote>

Using [the updated version](https://gist.github.com/3610635), we get the following:

```scala
scala> kind[Functor.type]
res1: String = Functor's kind is (* -> *) -> *. This is a type constructor that takes type constructor(s): a higher-kinded type.
```
