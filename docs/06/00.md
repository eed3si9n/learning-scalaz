[Yesterday][day5] we looked at `Monad` typeclass, which introduces `flatMap`. We looked at how monadic chaining can add contexts to values. Because both `Option` and `List` already have `flatMap` in the standard library, it was more about changing the way we see things rather than introducing new code. We also reviewed `for` syntax as a way of chaining monadic operations.

### for syntax again

There's a subtle difference in Haskell's `do` notation and Scala's `for` syntax. Here's an example of `do` notation:

```haskell
foo = do
  x <- Just 3
  y <- Just "!"
  Just (show x ++ y)
```

Typically one would write `return (show x ++ y)`, but I wrote out `Just`, so it's clear that the last line is a monadic value. On the other hand, Scala would look as follows:

```scala
scala> def foo = for {
         x <- 3.some
         y <- "!".some
       } yield x.shows + y
```

Looks almost the same, but in Scala `x.shows + y` is plain `String`, and `yield` forces the value to get in the context. This is great if we have the raw value. But what if there's a function that returns monadic value? 

```haskell
in3 start = do
  first <- moveKnight start
  second <- moveKnight first
  moveKnight second
```

We can't write this in Scala without extract the value from `moveKnight second` and re-wrapping it using yeild:

```scala
def in3: List[KnightPos] = for {
  first <- move
  second <- first.move
  third <- second.move
} yield third
```

This difference shouldn't pose much problem in practice, but it's something to keep in mind.
