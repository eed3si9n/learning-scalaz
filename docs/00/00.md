I never set out to do a "(you can) learn Scalaz in X days." [day 1][day1] was written on Auguest 31, 2012 while Scalaz 7 was in milestone 7. Then day 2 was written the next day, and so on. It's a web log of "(me) learning Scalaz." As such, it's terse and minimal. Some of the days, I spent more time reading the book and trying code than writing the post.

Before we dive into the details, today I'm going to try a prequel to ease you in. Feel free to skip this part and come back later.

### Intro to Scalaz

There have been several Scalaz intros, but the best I've seen is [Scalaz talk](http://vimeo.com/10482466) by Nick Partridge given at Melbourne Scala Users Group on March 22, 2010:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>Scalaz talk is up - <a href="http://bit.ly/c2eTVR">http://bit.ly/c2eTVR</a> Lots of code showing how/why the library exists</p>&mdash; Nick Partridge (@nkpart) <a href="https://twitter.com/nkpart/status/11172171016">March 28, 2010</a></blockquote>

I'm going to borrow some material from it.

Scalaz consists of three parts:

1. New datatypes (`Validation`, `NonEmptyList`, etc)
2. Extensions to standard classes (`OptionOps`, `ListOps`, etc)
3. Implementation of every single general functions you need (ad-hoc polymorphism, traits + implicits)
